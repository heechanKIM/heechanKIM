# Heechan Kim

As a junior engineer, I have a deep passion for all things Linux. I love exploring the command-line interface and discovering new ways to streamline workflows and improve productivity. In addition to my technical skills, I'm also interested in developing soft skills such as service ownership, customer-centric mindset, and knowledge sharing, which I believe are essential for success in any team environment. If you're interested in connecting and discussing technical or soft skill development topics,

While working as a DevOps Engineer at Mustit, I recognized the challenges that our internal developers faced with file sharing and transfer processes. To address these challenges, I took the initiative to develop an in-house file transfer platform that not only improved efficiency and productivity but also streamlined collaboration across different teams. This platform enabled the development team to share files securely and seamlessly, ultimately contributing to the success of our projects and the overall growth of the organization.

- Developed an in-house file transfer platform for an isolated network environment using network integration.
  - Improved the speed of encrypting and compressing large files into ZIP format by approximately 80% using optimized logic.

- Maintaining AWS cloud infrastructure of mustit e-commerce website.
  - Resolved EBS binding issue on EC2 instances hosting the deployed cache solution.

- Elastic Kubernetes Cluster Migration.
  - Prevented resource loss during cluster migration through automation of bash script

## These days
