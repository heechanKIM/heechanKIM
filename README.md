# Heechan Kim

As a junior engineer, I have a deep passion for all things Linux. I love exploring the command-line interface and discovering new ways to streamline workflows and improve productivity. In addition to my technical skills, I'm also interested in developing soft skills such as service ownership, customer-centric mindset, and knowledge sharing, which I believe are essential for success in any team environment. If you're interested in connecting and discussing technical or soft skill development topics,
