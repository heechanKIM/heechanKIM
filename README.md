# My Personal Profile
As a junior engineer, I have a deep passion for all things Linux. I love exploring the command-line interface and discovering new ways to streamline workflows and improve productivity. In addition to my technical skills, I'm also interested in developing soft skills such as service ownership, customer-centric mindset, and knowledge sharing, which I believe are essential for success in any team environment. If you're interested in connecting and discussing technical or soft skill development topics, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or Email.
